# Setup 

Clone this repository and change into the directory. Create a new virtualenv and activate it:

```
virtualenv venv
. venv/bin/activate
```

Proceed with the installation of all dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you get an error that `sqlite3worker` couldn't be installed, use 

```
pip install git+https://github.com/palantir/sqlite3worker#egg=sqlite3worker
```

and retry the installation.

Copy the sample files:

```
cp config.py.sample config.py
cp feeds.sql.sample feeds.sql
```

Edit `config.py` to fit your needs and IRC settings. All feeds from `feeds.sql` will be imported on the first start.

You might want to update all feeds before connecting to the IRC server to prevent spamming the channel (and optionally a ban from your IRC server). Either set `update_before_connecting = True` in the `config.py` or run the update script before starting the bot:

```
python2 feedupdater.py
```

To start the bot, run:

```
python2 main.py
```

If you want to run this as a systemd service, you can use the `rss2irc.service` file after adjusting the paths in there.

# Adding feeds
To add a new feed, edit the `feeds.sql` and import it to your sqlite database:

```
sqlite3 feeds.db < feeds.sql
```

And restart the bot.
